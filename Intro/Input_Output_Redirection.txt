Pipe "|" takes the result on the left and does something with it over on the right

Output:
$: cat ./cities.txt > /dev/stdout: greater than redirects the output
$: find ./scripts/ -size +80c > ./scripts/largefiles.txt: find any files over 80 char and output results to a file called largefiles.txt
$: find / -user smerz1 2> /dev/null: 2 means error messages, /dev/null is a way to suppress things/get rid of. I could send them to a file here instead

$: find /home -user smerz1 | tee user1_files.txt
The tee command, used with a pipe, reads standard input, then writes the output of a program to standard output and simultaneously copies it into the specified file or files

Input:
$: sort < cities.txt: input cities.txt and sort the file. Will not do it permanently to the file
$: grep -i "t" < cities.txt: -i is case insensitive, feed in cities.txt and look for the letter "t"

Both:
sort < cities.txt > sorted_cities.txt
